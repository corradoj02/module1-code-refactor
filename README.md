# UCI Coding Bootcamp Module 01 Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

The importance of web accessibility is one that businesses have to seriously consider when building their sites. The goal of this challenge is to better understand web accessibility as well as to be able to read and refactor someone else's code to make a site more accessible for others. 

I will do this using the following using the following User Story and Acceptance Criteria as taken from the UCI Coding Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge:

# User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

# UCI Coding Bootcamp Module 01 Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

The importance of web accessibility is one that businesses have to seriously consider when building their sites. The goal of this challenge is to better understand web accessibility as well as to be able to read and refactor someone else's code to make a site more accessible for others. 

I will do this using the following using the following User Story and Acceptance Criteria as taken from the UCI Coding Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge:

# User Story

**AS A** marketing agency  
**I WANT** a codebase that follows accessibility standards  
**SO THAT** our own site is optimized for search engines  

# Acceptance Criteria

**GIVEN** a webpage meets accessibility standards  
**WHEN** I view the source code  
**THEN** I find semantic HTML elements  
**WHEN** I view the structure of the HTML elements  
**THEN** I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning  
**WHEN** I view the image elements  
**THEN** I find accessible alt attributes  
**WHEN** I view the heading attributes  
**THEN** they fall in sequential order  
**WHEN** I view the title element  
**THEN** I find a concise, descriptive title
